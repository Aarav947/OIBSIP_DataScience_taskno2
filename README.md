Unemployment Analysis with Python


## Problem Statement
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which represents the percentage of unemployed people in the total labour force. During the Covid-19 pandemic, India experienced a sharp rise in unemployment due to lockdowns and economic disruptions. This project analyzes unemployment trends across different regions and time periods in India.

## Dataset
The project uses unemployment data provided in CSV format, containing monthly unemployment statistics across various Indian states and regions. The dataset includes unemployment rate, employed population, labour participation rate, and area classification (rural/urban).

## Approach
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle date formats and column inconsistencies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using visualizations to study trends over time, regional differences, and the impact of Covid-19. Key insights are derived from graphical analysis.

## Key Insights
- A sharp spike in unemployment during the Covid-19 lockdown period
- Urban areas were more affected compared to rural areas
- Significant regional variations in unemployment trends
- Gradual recovery observed after lockdown relaxation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
